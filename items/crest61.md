<span class="first">T</span>his project was definitely a long time coming, and is my first major project (although still in its first revision). It is, interestingly, a perfect first project which introduced me into the hobby electronics world, deriving from my interest with keyboards.

This surprisingly is only my second keyboard build, much farther down the rabbit hole than you would expect by now, but that's only because my dwindling funds could not support a new keyboard purchase every single time a [nice case](https://www.alexotos.com/neo-ergo-review/) dropped, or a [new switch](https://www.theremingoat.com/blog/gateron-g-pro-3-yellow-switch-review) caught my interest. *(I sure was tempted though)*

So I decided to jump straight to endgame(ish) and build my own from scratch, using help from:
 - [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UXsD7nSfDY&list=WL&index=56) from Christian Selig
 - [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_VuXVErD6E&list=WL&index=55) amongst others from Ben Vallack
 - and [FlatFootFox's](https://flatfootfox.com/ergogen-introduction/) amazing Ergogen guide

## Overview

    - which have japanese legends on them, since they were the only ones available ðŸ˜” oh well...
