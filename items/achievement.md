## Main Logic

## Background
This project was started almost exactly a year before the article was written, early-mid 2024, while I was sitting around trying to figure out which game to full complete next on steam. 

That was a terrible time... I had no idea what I was doing. Perhaps evident by the fact that I had my steam api key floating around hardcoded client side in a public repo which I have since redacted using [bfg](https://rtyley.github.io/bfg-repo-cleaner/).. :skull:

I then spent the next few hours attempting to salvage my sub par code by redirecting all client steam api calls towards a backend, which just adds the key to the url. 

>successfully fixed the code (so that it isnt stupid) as of 2025-05-17 :grin:
