This project was started almost exactly a year before the article was written, early-mid 2024, while I was sitting around trying to figure out which game to full complete next on steam. 

That was a terrible time... I had no idea what I was doing. Perhaps evident by the fact that I had my steam api key floating around in a public repo which I have since redacted using [bfg](https://rtyley.github.io/bfg-repo-cleaner/).. :skull:

I then subsequently spent a few hours cleaning up the code and setting up hosting on [render](https://render.com/) with the client sending requests to the server backend which holds the api key.
