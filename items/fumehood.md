<span class="first">W</span>ith more and more projects being made, it eventually it had to happen. I couldn't spend my days inhaling lead and flux fumes every time I needed so solder ðŸ’€. 

I needed a fume hood, something to make my poorly ventilated workspace **safe** enough to work in. I was quite shocked though when I found out these simple machines typically come to around 80 Australian dollars ðŸ˜². So... Instead of buying one online, perhaps the more **sensible** choice, I decided to scrap together my own from an 120mm pc fan... 

This will be a fairly short entry, since the design of this was quite simple. It took a few hours to go from concept to completion.

### Parts

The build features a near standard [120mm pc case fan](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005005824724009.html), with no control wire since I'd never need to slow it down.

Other than that,
- a 25mm depth sheet of activated carbon filter
- standard 5.5 * 2.5 mm female barrel jack
- 240v ac to 12v [dc converter](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005001731366424.html)
- [KCD11 rocker switch](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000973563250.html)

With electronics linked together in series.

### Design

This project is simple, a fan needs to **push** or **pull** air through a carbon filter with enough airflow to reach at least a few centimeters past the front. Doing this, the fumes will be trapped in the filter instead of let into the air. 

Additionally, the powering of the fan needs to be simple; There needs to be an unpluggable jack, and an on/off switch. 

For ease of use, a mount point should be included for my set of helping hands, so that it can be held close against the active piece.

The case was designed simply to surround the fan, hold the filter, and enclose some very simple electronics.

For easier printing, the case is split into two and glue together afterwards. The filter is also placed in directly.

### Final words

In the end, it turned out to be a pretty good fix for an issue I've been having for a while.

Lets hope it continues working ðŸ¤—!
