<span class="first">W</span>ith more and more projects being made, it eventually it had to happen. I couldn't spend my days inhaling lead and flux fumes every time I needed so solder ðŸ’€. 

I needed a fume hood, something to make my poorly ventilated workspace "safe" enough to work in. Instead of buying one online, perhaps the more sensible choice, I decided to scrap together my own, from a 120mm pc fan.

This will be a fairly short entry, since the design of this was comically simple. It took a few hours in one day to complete.

### Parts

The build features a near standard 120mm pc case fan, with no control wire, as there isn't a need to slow it down.

Other than that,
- a 25mm depth sheet of activated carbon filter
- standard 5.5 * 2.5 mm female barrel jack
- 240v ac to 12v [dc converter](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005001731366424.html)
- [KCD11 rocker switch](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000973563250.html)

With electronics linked together in series.

### Design

This project is simple, a fan needs to push or pull air through a carbon filter with enough airflow to reach at least a few centimeters past the front.

Additionally, the powering of the fan needs to be simple; There needs to be an unpluggable jack, and an on/off switch.

Finally, for easy of use, a mount point should be included for my set of helping hands, so that it can be held close against the active piece.

The case was designed simply to surround the fan, hold the filter, and enclose some very simple electronics.

For easier printing, the case is split into two and glue together afterwards. The filter is also placed in directly.
