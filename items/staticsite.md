<span class="first">T</span>his post is about its own parent site, a statically generated portfolio built using Next.js. All of the posts written before this date were actually written in retrospect, and dated for when the projects were created.

So how does this site actually work? ðŸ¤”

As seen in the above flowchart, the site is generated statically using Next.js with the functions `getStaticPaths()` and `getStaticProps()`. 

On build time, a template file `[name].tsx` otherwise commonly called `[slug].tsx` calls the functions `getStaticPaths()`

```javascript line-numbers
export const getStaticPaths = async () => {

  const files = fs.readdirSync('items') //read item folder

  return {
    paths: files.map(filename => ({ //for each item
      params: {
        name: filename.replace(".md", "") //removes .md from file name
      }
    })),
    fallback: false
  }
}
```

which instantiates a new page for every file in the directory 'items'.

Each of these pages then calls a `getStaticProps()` with its own name pass through as an arguement wrapped in an object, which pulls the pages header and contents, and parses contents from markdown to html using [remarkjs](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark).

```javascript
export const getStaticProps = async ({params: { name }}) => {

  //Each file has its contents pulled out
  const contents = fs.readFileSync(path.join('items',name+'.md')).toString();
  //Split into an object with a metadata header
  const parsedContents = matter(contents);
  //Parsed into html with prism syntax highlighting
  const processedContent = await remark()
    .use(html, { sanitize: false })
    .use(prism) 
    .process(parsedContents.content);
  //Converted from json to string
  const markdownContents = processedContent.toString();

  return {
    props: {
      //properties of contents and data are returned
      contents: markdownContents, //String
      data: parsedContents.data //Object with fields from header
    }
  }
}
```


The header is formatted as such (with this project as an example)
```javascript
---
title: "A Next.js Static Site Generator"
date: "2025-04-19"
tags: ["project"]
---
```
Each field value pair is parsed into a data object with [gray matter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gray-matter).


Then, these properties are passed to the page to be rendered with JSX expressions and dangerously setting innerhtml as a HTML attribute.

```javascript
<div className="markdownbody" dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: contents }}></div>
```

All of the individual pages are pulled together with a hyperlink index in index.tsx

```javascript
{projects.map((name) =>  <li key={name.data.title}><Link className="linkClass" href={`/${name.filename}`}>{name.data.title}</Link></li>)} // for projects

{misc.map((name) =>  <li key={name.data.title}><Link className="linkClass" href={`/${name.filename}`}>{name.data.title}</Link></li>)}// for misc
```

Code density wise this project is pretty light, but it took me a few different approaches and perspectives to get it up and running. A *lot* was learnt about how Next.js works. ðŸ¤—
